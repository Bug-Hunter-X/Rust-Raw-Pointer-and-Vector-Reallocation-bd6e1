This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust related to using raw pointers with vectors.  The code attempts to modify a vector directly via its raw pointer.  However, vectors can reallocate their underlying memory when they grow, invalidating any existing raw pointers. Attempting to dereference an invalid pointer leads to undefined behavior, often a panic. The solution demonstrates safe alternatives using vector indexing or iterators.
